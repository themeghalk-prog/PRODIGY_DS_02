This repository contains a comprehensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization project performed on the Titanic test.csv dataset. The analysis covers initial data inspection, handling missing values (imputation and column removal), statistical summaries, and the generation of various plots (histograms, count plots, correlation heatmaps, and box plots) to identify patterns, trends, and key relationships within the data.
